## NY Style

### Dough (this makes one 16inch pie)

#### Ingredients:
- (100%) [241g] Robin Hood All-Purpose Flour
- (1.8%) [4.3g] Kosher salt
- (2.5%) [6g] Olive oil
- (2%) [4.8g] Granulated Sugar
- (62%) [149g] Room-temp water
- (0.5%) [0.46g] IDY Yeast

#### Instructions:
1. Mix all of the ingredients in a large bowl (I use a stand mixer)
2. Stop and let the flour absorb the water for ~10 minutes
3. Knead in the bowl for ~5 minutes (halved if using a stand mixer)
4. Let it rest for ~10 minutes
5. Knead again for ~5 minutes (halved if using a stand mixer)
6. Form your dough balls (about 400g each for a 16inch pie)
7. Lightly oil the top and bottom of each ball and place them in the center of a round container (helps keep the round shape)
8. Cover with lightly-oiled cling-wrap
9. Let rest in the fridge for (preferably) 3 days. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months

### Sauce

#### Ingredients:
- Bianca DiNapoli Crushed Tomatoes
- Salt
- Fresh Basil
- Fresh Oregano
- Dried Basil
- Dried Oregano

#### Instructions:
1. Combine all ingredients together in a bowl, adding each spice to taste
2. Use 1-2 laddle's-worth per pie, making sure to spread evenly to the crust-shape
3. Freeze the remainder for up to ~3 months. To defrost, simply place it in the fridge for ~24 hours

### Pizza Prep

#### Ingredients:
- Full-fat low-moisture mozzarella (Balls are preferred, then either shred it by hand / food processor or slice it very thin)
- Provolone (shredded by hand / food processor or thinly sliced) (optional, I find a ratio of 60/40 Mozz/Provolone is a good fat balance)
- Parmesan (optional, adds a bit more depth)

#### Instructions:
1. Remove from the fridge 2-4 hours before shaping
2. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible for an hour (550f in my case) and if you have a pizza stone/steel, place it in the oven
3. Heavily flour your work surface
4. Place your dough ball onto the surface, and flip it over once or twice to coat it with flour
5. Begin forming your crust all around the edges of the pizza with your fingers
6. Once your dough has been stretched enough by hand, take your dough and place it on top of your knuckles
7. Begin rotating the the dough, making sure that your knuckles stay near the edge of the dough
8. Once your dough is the appropriate size, place it onto a heavily floured pizza peel
9. Laddle your sauce onto the dough and give your peel a jiggle to the left and right
10. Grate some fresh parmesan onto the sauce
11. Add your (shredded by hand) full-fat low-moisture Mozzarella and some Provolone on top (I do a 60/40 mix) and once again, jiggle the peel, making sure that the pizza isn't sticking
12. Add remaining toppings like pepperoni, and launch the pizza
13. At around 550f, the pizza cooks in 6-8 minutes
